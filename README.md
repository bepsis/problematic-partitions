# Problematic Partitions
Exploring approximations of [Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan)'s deceptively simple [partition function](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartitionFunctionP.html).

Using polynomial linear regression, one can train a regressor to generate a function which is pretty accurate, and is also really fast. Below is a graph showing how Ramanujan's approximation function (green), the actual partition function (blue), and my approximation (red) compare.
